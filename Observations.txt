Three Observable Trends:

1. It is clear that the vast majority of players of Heroes of Pymoli are male. 
Males, therefore also account for the most dollars spent. However, males do not necessarily spend more individually than the other gender categories - in fact, they narrowly spend less per person.

2. By far the largest age demographic for HoP is the 20-24 age group.
This demographic alone accounts for almost half of the total dollars spent in the game. But again, members of this age group do not necessarily spend more individually than other age groups. They are actually narrowly outspended by the "Under 10" group, as well as the "35-39's".

3. The Final Critic and the Oathbreaker are the two most popular purchasable items in the game.
